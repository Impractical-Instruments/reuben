//! The two engine-facing planes the five engine tools drive, and the [`EngineLink`] that holds
//! both.
//!
//! The planes stay separate on purpose. Structure edits ride a **loopback-only** TCP/NDJSON channel
//! ([`StructureClient`], #315) because they are more powerful than OSC control; OSC control rides
//! UDP to an endpoint the engine binds on all interfaces. `EngineLink` owns one handle to each
//! rather than merging them, so a call site names the plane it is using.
//!
//! There is no engine-facing trait. The injectable seam is one layer down —
//! [`StructureTransport`](crate::StructureTransport), the socket itself — so tool-body tests
//! exercise real NDJSON serialization, real parsing, and the real unreachable classification
//! instead of a hand-written stand-in for them.
//!
//! # Act-then-map, not probe-then-act
//!
//! The structure-channel tools (`swap`, `get_current_instrument`, `get_diagnostics`) run their
//! real exchange and map [`StructureError::is_unreachable`] to the fail-fast
//! [`crate::engine_unreachable`] result — one connection, no TOCTOU window between a separate
//! liveness probe and the act. `send` is the one probe-first tool: UDP is silent
//! about a dead port, so it pings the structure channel before dispatching datagrams.
//!
//! see rules: agent-mcp
