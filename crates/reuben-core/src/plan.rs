//! Plan — the static execution image produced by Instantiate (ADR-0009, ADR-0010, ADR-0030).
//!
//! Instantiate consumes a [`Graph`], topologically orders its nodes, instantiates each operator
//! (config-fixed, off the hot path), and assigns every Buffer output port a slot in the edge-buffer
//! arena. The result is immutable and is what [`crate::render`] executes per block. Polyphony is
//! hosted inside the Voicer (N voice sub-plans summed), not fanned out across engine Lanes — the
//! Lane model is gone (ADR-0032).
//!
//! The seven former carriers collapse to one model (ADR-0030): every input port has a held
//! [`Arg`] **latch** (the ZOH value `io.input::<T>` reads), Buffer inputs additionally carry a dense
//! arena buffer, and every output port either owns arena buffers (a Buffer/signal output) or
//! routes emitted Messages to downstream input ports (a message output). The old context-arena /
//! enum-latch / param lanes and the separate `msg_targets` / `ctx_targets` routing are unified.
